### Summary
I was born 1977

I started with SEO website promotion.

Gradually began to produce sites using popular free CMS.

I wanted more understanding and opportunities. I started learning layout on my own, then JavaScript.

To understand how CMS works, I started learning PHP on my own. I took courses on Wordpress and ModX. I can make
websites using my own layout and make some changes to the BackEnd on these systems.

**Goal**: to move away from website promotion and focus on development and programming.
